tagline: A fast, easy and free BitTorrent client with VPN support
description: >-
  Transmission is designed for easy, powerful use with the added benefit of VPN support through haugene/transmission-openvpn. This ensures your torrenting activities are secure and private. 

  Transmission has one of the lowest memory & resource footprints of any major BitTorrent client. It's light overhead makes it well suited for home NAS and media servers. 

  Transmission is an open source, volunteer-based project. It doesn't play games with its users to make money. We don't bundle toolbars, pop-up ads, flash ads, twitter tools, or anything else. It doesn't hold some features back for a payware version. We don't track our users. Our website and forums have no third-party ads or analytics.

  ⚠️ Please note that while Transmission uses VPN for secure torrenting, it downloads torrents over the Clearnet, not Tor.
